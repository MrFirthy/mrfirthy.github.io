        <h1>Now</h1>
        <h2>May 2021</h2>
        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Still rotating between Fifa and Fortnite for short, social gaming as opposed to long, story-heavy solo games. There are some good games in that category that are gathering dust in the home office now...</li>
            <li>Used recovering from laser eye surgery to finally try out Audible and I must say I'm impressed (prices notwithstanding). Enjoying listening to the red rising trilogy whilst I walk and work out.</li>
            <li>Tracking the films I watch using <a href="https://letterboxd.com/mrfirthy/films/" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a> these days. Recently very surprised by how good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_to_Busan" target="_blank">Train to Busan</a> was.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Oh my word. Being back at a real gym every day is something I'll never take for granted again. Huge improvement in energy and outlook already.</li>
            <li>My VanMoof encountered an issue and I've had to wait weeks for a service appointment. Glad to have it back now, and was a reminder of how much I love it.</li>
            <li>Had laser eye surgery for the second time and it was a huge success. Bit of healing left to do but already so happy I did it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Still super happy at Octopus Energy. Right now the challenge is settling in the wave of new people in the team, and getting more comfortable managing people of different disciplines.</li>
            <li>Going to be a technical reviewer on a book for the first time! It's for Apress (the same folks that published my book), and will be helping someone at Spotify who's writing a book about accessibility for wearables. More on this to come!</li>
            <li>After a small hiatus, I've started consulting on accessibility for other companies again. If you find yourself in need of that, you can <a href="/get-advice">check out this page</a></li>
        </ul>
