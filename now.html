        <h1>Now</h1>
        <h2>January 2021</h2>
        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Juggling playing Borderlands 3, The Last of Us, and Shadow of War on a PS4 that all need finishing (whilst falling back to Fifa, Fortnite, and Among Us when I don’t have the energy to get into story-based games).</li>
            <li>Currently reading <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Ready_Player_Two/FOHtDwAAQBAJ?hl=en">Ready Player Two</a>, and looking forward to reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Without-Work-Technology-Automation/dp/0141986808/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=54044312100&dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkbgyLSsM7dstPvpHRIyTm0RxzYeFEMbUCtQy8QKKnJ6pNlCS69Mf0hoC2WwQAvD_BwE&hvadid=259061351973&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1006886&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=6779921976152305711&hvtargid=kwd-309663041409&hydadcr=24427_1748929&keywords=a+world+without+work&qid=1610233777&quartzVehicle=4015-1880&replacementKeywords=a+world+without&sr=8-1&tag=googhydr-21">a world without work</a>.</li>
            <li>Have given up on listening to podcasts recently, as I haven’t found any I’ve been hooked by. Replaced them with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0vvXsWCC9xrXsKd4FyS8kM?si=ivldJRSQQEipx3RBsKWcUQ">lo-fi beats</a> whilst I work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Doing my best to keep a regular exercise routine with Third Space closed for the foreseeable future. It’s amazing what you can do with two pairs of dumbbells and some resistance bands.</li>
            <li>Currently waiting on the return of both UFC and F1, and expecting Football to take a break soon as well given the circumstances and recent outbreaks.</li>
            <li>Incredibly gratefully to be spending the third lockdown in a new flat with more space and a proper office.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Loving my job at Octopus Energy, and excited for the new countries we’re expanding into (despite the timezone trickiness).</li>
            <li>Working hard to set boundaries between work and life, starting with finishing at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Growing the team feels great, the recruitment process definitely does not.</li>
        </ul>
