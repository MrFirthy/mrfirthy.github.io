        <h1>Now</h1>
        <h2>Feb 2022</h2>
        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Genuinely still enjoying playing Fortnite! At this point though, you have to play at certain times of day to avoid all of the pro kids that live on the game.</li>
            <li>Finally started playing The Last of Us and it's a fantastoc game. Keen to finish it and head straight over to another zombie movie in the form of Dying Light 2.</li>
            <li>Reading a lot of non-fiction at present, including No Rules Rules and Billion Dollar Whale. I need to find a book that really draws me in for the first time in a while.</li>
            <li>Still tracking the films I watch using <a href="https://letterboxd.com/mrfirthy/films/" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a> these days. Spiral is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and Spiderman: No way home was far beyond what I expected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Training is going very well. Setting the goal of going to the gym regularly, even if it's not for the sake of a full throttle work out</li>
            <li>After contracting COVID over the Christmas period, it feels as though me and my partner haven't had a proper break. We're going to head to the Maldives for a week to try and sort that out!</li>
            <li>Started getting back into playing pool again which I'm really enjoying. It helps that I can play at a spot that has limited signal and so work doesn't threaten to clobber it...</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My team at Octopus Energy has been growing at hyper speed. Right now the focus is getting our newest countries of Spain, Italy, and France up to speed to bring Octopus to new corners of Europe.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed being a technical reviewer on a book around accessibility. It's certainly far less intense than writing one! It feels great to help make a great book on an important topic better.</li>
            <li>My laptop's battery finally gave out, so I'm now on a tasty new M1 MacBook Pro. It's insanely fast, and I haven't heard the fans turn on once, but there's also a LOT of M1 chip quirks that have made setting up everything a pain.</li>
        </ul>
