            <h1>Accessibility matters.</h1>
            <p>An in-depth analysis of your site's accessibility, delivered in a case study format - super easy to understand and implement.</p>

            <h2>What's the point?</h2>
            <p>Those who have <em>built</em> a site do not experience it in the same way that many of their users do. At the same time, many people don't know how that experience differs and how to check it. Accessibility has sadly been an industry afterthought for a while - not focused on in courses or degrees, and no clear checks or practices to follow. That's where I come in.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>What else do you offer?</h2>
            <p>Beyond the audits and plans, I also offer training sessions for your team/company. I can start simple, by taking everyone through an introduction to accessibility, and go all the way to the complexities of designing for a particular strain of colour blindness. Again, it's entirely dependent on your situation, but an audit can often showcase where your weaknesses lie, and I can suggest areas of improvement. Training is an extra cost, and can be booked in without an audit, but is discounted if I've audited you before.</p>

                        <p>You'll get a breakdown of the current state of your site and its accessibility. It'll focus on a range of disabilities and access needs, so you know the improvements are to practically help people, rather than to just tick regulatory boxes. It'll also contain a plan.</p>

                        <p>With every audit being different, there isn't really a standard rate to discount. However if you buy a copy of my book, I'll be sure to knock &pound;50 off! üòâ</p>
