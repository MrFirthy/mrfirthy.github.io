		<p>I built and lead the Front-end department at Octopus Energy, crafting sites and internal tools, building new products and campaigns, and expanding into other countries. Our aim is to combat climate change, use technology to build a better standard of energy supplier, and make renewable energy more affordable for everyone. In May 2020, Octopus Energy became the 15th UK tech <strong>“unicorn”</strong> after achieving a valuation of <a href="https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-energy-achieves-unicorn-status-investment-origin-energy/">over &pound;1 billion</a>. A huge passion of mine at Octopus is <strong>web accessibility</strong>; ensuring we have a usable, enjoyable experience for everyone regardless of their disability or access needs. If you’re interested, I've written a book about it, <a href="https://inclusive.guide">which you can learn more about here</a>.</p>
