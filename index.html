			<h4><a href="https://octopus.energy/agile">Agile Octopus</a></h4>
			<p>The first tariff ever to update its prices every 30 minutes based on smart meter data, Agile Octopus is a 100% renewable Electricity tariff that offers insight into the cheapest times for customers to use energy, and 'plunge pricing' events which actually pay customers to use energy at times when demand to the grid is low and supply is high. I built the front-end for this.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://octopus.energy/tracker">Octopus Tracker</a></h4>
			<p>I created the front-end as we created and launched the <strong>industry’s first</strong> tracker tariff, where the price changes everyday in line with the wholesale cost of energy. It provides customers with a detailed cost breakdown, including the margin made by the company. This was a solo Front-end build that involved <strong>HTML5 canvas</strong> for handling the visualisation of data.</p>

All of these needed to adhere to the tech standards at Octopus, whilst being <strong>faithful to the M&amp;S brand</strong>.</p>
