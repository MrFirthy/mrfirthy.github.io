		<h3><a href="https://learna11y.com">Practical Web Inclusion and Accessibility</a></h3>
		<p>My first book, published with <a href="https://apress.com">Apress</a>, is about web accessibility. This book will guide you through a broad range of access needs, the barriers users often face, and provide practical advice on how your sites can help rather than hinder. Going beyond advice tailored solely for developers, this book offers potential improvements for designers, developers, user experience professionals, QA and testers, so that everyone involved in building a website can benefit.</p>
