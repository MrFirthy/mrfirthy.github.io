    <p>Hey booth! Dropping by to let you know that I have just finished my first week of placement! It&#039;s been absolutely awesome. I&#039;ve learnt so much in such a short space of time and I still have 5 more weeks of it left!<br />
<br />
This has shown me that this is definitely the line of work that I want to go in to. Which is a very nice idea =]<br />

    <p>Hey all! =] So I&#039;m back home for a little while to get some much needed rest after the second year of my degree finished last week. Just before  left Bournemouth for a while though, Apple were kind enough to send me a little certificate for the online sales training I had to do for my job. Pretty swanky (especially in the eyes of an Apple fanboy =D)<br />
<br />
So the next couple of days will involve me catching up on a few shows, reading a couple of books and taking the well-deserved rest that feels months overdue =]<br />
<br />
How is your week panning out?</p>

    <p>Hey boothworld. Thought I&#039;d pop back in for a quick visit to let you know that I&#039;VE FINISHED THE SECOND YEAR OF MY DEGREE! =D Very good times!<br />
<br />
Got the results back for my last assignment of the year and got two 1st&#039;s! Nice way to end it.Will have to wait and see what I get for the year overall. So now I can take a few days to myself to relax and catch up on general stuff (like this!) before I go on placement for 6 years (note: pretty excited about that!)<br />
<br />
This is a picture of me and the pre-drinks for my 21st birthday. Me and some mates hired out a bar, had some live bands play, then headed out to a few clubs. Pretty amazing night!<br />
<br />
How is everyone?</p>

    <p>Hair has become dramatically shorter! Got it cut last night (just in case you saw last nights booth and were like &quot;what the hell?&quot;) Much nicer now as I don&#039;t have to keep sweeping it out of my eyes =]. Also, it&#039;s not officially my 21st yet, It&#039;s simply premature birthday decorations from my mum as we are having a meal tonight to celebrate it as I will be in Bournemouth for my actual 21st. Will get to see a few family members tonight as well which should be good fun.<br />

<br />
I&#039;d love to promise more regular booths from now on, but in all honesty that won&#039;t happen until my second year of university is finished. The good news? it&#039;s only a couple of weeks away!<br />

    <p>Sorry about the strange picture Dailybooth, I&#039;m just practising for a meeting I have with a client tomorrow. Y&#039;see the site he wanted has been online and active for a while now. He has also had an invoice for the lovely work that me and @Aleece3 have done on it.<br />
<br />
However....<br />
<br />
...I get no money. Still. So we are meeting tomorrow to run him through how to use his on-site blog etc. and I have to basically tell him to pay me or I&#039;m going to take his site down. Harsh I know but I guess this is all part of learning how to be a proper freelancer =].<br />

Has been a fairly boring day. Brother turns 18 tomorrow which should be fun. Just been listening to a LOT of music. Gorillaz is flavour of the day. Such a great band.<br />

    <p>So I&#039;ve decided to make a grand return to boothing! I seem to have enough free time to keep this up again so I&#039;M BACK!<br />
<br />
...I also decided this while sat in pyjamas, so here&#039;s a fairly recent and arty photo of me to tide you guys over til I start taking awkward webcam photos again. But hey! you&#039;ve been waiting for ages already, what&#039;s one more day right? =]</p>

    <p>ARGH! darkness in the studio! So I came in this morning with @MattC to find that the lights had gone out in the radio room. So instead we have this rather spooky high beam light to use while we present news stuffs! fun times.<br />
<br />
On a dry run before us two and @RandomProdInc officially start broadcasting on FM radio exciting times!</p>

    <p>And I&#039;m geekin...just geekin&#039; in the rain.<br />
<br />
Terrible weather, but work to be done. Oh well...<br />
<br />
How is the weather with you?</p>

    <p>Yay for work!...<br />
<br />
...so I may have slightly exaggerated the excitement there. The weather is pretty terrible in Bournemouth today which has naturally kept everyone indoors. Not awesome considering today was the last day of our 3 day sale.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, what has everyone else been up to today?</p>

    <p>Hey there boothworld! Just boothing while broadcasting mine and @RandomProdInc &#039;s radio show (and who says men can&#039;t multitask!). For those of you I haven&#039;t told (which is most of you seeing as I&#039;ve never advertised it on dailybooth!) me and Tom host a show on our uni&#039;s radio network Nerve Radio, every other thursday from 2-4pm. Next one is in 2 weeks time and you can listen/watch us on webcam by clicking the link below!:<br />
<br />
http://www.nerveradio.com<br />
<br />
However, in a few weeks time, out uni will be broadcasting on FM radio for nearly 2 weeks, so all UK people can tune in with their radios if they find themselves in/near to the south coast, and we&#039;re pretty excited about this. There will be general banter, interviews with famous peeps and competitions with prizes with any luck!. <br />
<br />
You can keep up to date with all the goings on with the show by liking the facebook group (again link below). Better get back to Dj&#039;ing. Talk soon! =]<br />

    <p>&quot;So how does that work then?...&quot;<br />
<br />
So today is my first full day back at home for god knows how long, and with the family all off doing their own thing, it left me with the house to myself (and an endless supply of snacks) to do some proper code experimenting for the first time in what feels like ages.<br />
<br />
Managed to get some great ideas and make a couple of pretty cool things so all in all time well spent! Getting stuck in to that sort of stuff also helps combat the loneliness to =/ lol. Definitely looking forward to tomorrow though when @RobinJ6 comes round to add a bit of Logic to my day =D (really bad music pun, apologies lol).<br />
<br />
What have you guys been up to today?</p>

    <p>YAY! xD So air punch is for good reason, as I handed in my essay today!. It&#039;s been a massive brain ache from the start and I;m really happy that the unit has come to an end. I&#039;ve put a hell of a lot of effort in to this assignment (mainly as I didn&#039;t really know much even after all of the lectures!) so regardless of the mark (which I&#039;m praying will be a half decent one!) I&#039;m really pleased, and a little bit proud, of myself for pulling through it.<br />
<br />
Just a couple more days now until reading week, where I can get back to stuff I actually enjoy doing. Namely, messing around with website work, playing XBox and creating some sick tunes with @RobinJ6 =D.</p>

    <p>Well this is awkward, you&#039;ve caught me right in the middle of me feverishly devouring my essay! On a serious not though, this assignment is breaking me inside. Not knowing much at all about the topic (even after going to the lectures) leaves me a little bit lost on what to write, and if what I&#039;ve written even makes sense. I must have looked over this bloody thing dozens of times and all that happens if that I change some sentence structure and hate what I&#039;ve already written even more!<br />
<br />
God bless production assignments that&#039;s all I can say; at least there&#039;s a clear right and wrong way with code. I&#039;m going to need a bloody amazing mark in production to drag up what will inevitably be an appalling essay mark.<br />
<br />
Be right back, off to nom some more...</p>

    <p>Hey boothers! So today at work I got pretty bored on my lunch break (in between noms) and decided I would try out a new app. I settled on instagram and I&#039;m a big fan of it now! It&#039;s basically hipstamatic but free. Lol :). This is the first picture I took on it using one of the funky filters, you like?</p>
  </div>

    <p>So how about this for an accurate visual representation of my day?. It&#039;s been a long day of work for me yet again. From long coding workshops, to pitching game designs, to going to presentations for potential client work, to helping out 1st years on my course with coding problems, to trying to write an essay that has to be in next thursday (minus the fact that I know absolutely nothing about the unit =/). It all seems like a tad too much for me these days.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, after the essay is handed in next week I should have a bit less to worry about! There is also a reading week coming up. A precious 7 days where I can actually go home, see my family and RELAX. The though alone is amazing.<br />
<br />
So here I am, typing away with my mind clearly in some other place far away.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you could be anywhere in the world right now. Where would you be?...I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t be sat behind a computer =P</p>

    <p>Hey Boothworld! So I though I&#039;d be polite and drop in to say hi, seeing as it&#039;s been a while, even by my standards, since my last booth =]. It appears that a lot has changed since I was last here too! The new Dailybooth layout gets an overall rating of sublimely awesome! some really cool additions on the last version!. I have also noticed that a certain @bennuk has joined the ranks of the boothers so welcome him! maybe give him a cheeky follow. He works for microsoft you know! =]<br />
<br />
Only major development today has been that I purchased a new keyboard for my desk set up. Although it was simply to add to the laziness so now I don&#039;t even need to reach up to the laptop on the stand to type...yup, it&#039;s a lazy as it sounds xD.<br />
<br />
So speaking of stuff that&#039;s new, what&#039;s new in your lives lovely followers? =]</p>

    <p>Hey boothers! How is it going? So it&#039;s been a fairly hectic day today. After finishing work a mere hour and a half ago, I have managed to pack up the majority of possessions that I own and get myself on to a train. On the positive side, the train is taking me home for Christmas!!! :D quite excited I must say. <br />
<br />
Where is home for you? And what makes it christmas for you? :)</p>

    <p>Hey again booth people :) Now that I have finished my first term at uni, and am suitably kitted up with a new MacBook and iPhone, I thought it was about time I got back to boothing :) so hey! I&#039;m taking this from my iPhone as I&#039;m still at work (cheeky I know lol) what have you guys been up to?</p>

    <p>Time to say goodbye to the old Maccy dailyboothers!. This lovely silvery block of awesome has been an awesome laptop. It was my first ever mac, my tool of productivity for my first, and part of my second, year at uni, and has been an allround brilliant piece of tech.<br />
However, today my new beast of a laptop arrived to take it&#039;s place, and so the little guy is being sold to someone at uni =[.<br />
<br />
Everybody say goodbye!</p>

    <p>Guess who&#039;s back?! So it&#039;s been a very long time since I last boothed. I&#039;ll be honest...I have been super busy. However, I always enjoy being part of this little community, so I&#039;m making an exerted effort to start boothing again!.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m at home for one night only tonight to see my family. I&#039;ve been so busy this week, even though it&#039;s supposed to be my week off, that this is the only evening of the week I have free! =/.<br />
<br />
I got a new haircut too, do you like?. If you want to see what I&#039;ve been up to in the past couple of weeks, you need look no further than my portfolio website!<br />

I&#039;m really pleased with how they came out and the fact that my business cards are now actually the same style as my website =P. I&#039;m all ready to start really networking now! =].<br />
<br />
In other news, this evening myself, IMP house occupants and Alex Steve and Andy all went off to get some nice Nando&#039;s for tea. Then we attempted to go and watch the social network but unfortunately it was sold out =/. Hopefully will see it next week though! =]<br />

Me and Aleece are just taking a well-deserved rest for the rest of the evening after doing a tonne of Unity work. So she is playing Lego Indiana Jones on my Xbox 360 while I play Dawn of War: Soulstorm on her PC. Good trade! =D She loves the lego games, she only looks sad here because she died while I took this picture =P. <br />

This be booth numero uno! xD. It&#039;s my first booth back at uni properly (on campus and not in some silly hotel suite lol). I start with a workshop and then I give my very first PAL session to my group of first year students!. Exciting/nervous much! =]<br />

<br />
Hence the strange open-mouthed expression! lol. Today was also the last day we had to spend at the Carrington hotel because of my uni induction, so as of next week I get to head to uni like usual! =].

    <p>ARGH! what a boring evening =[ just finished writing cue cards for the presentation that me and my group are giving tomorrow. It has been a very long day considering that this was the only day this week when we could make our own work schedule (note: maybe I work too hard? =/). Anyhoo, they are done now so all that is left is to use them tomorrow! hopefully the idea goes down well with the lecturers because this is the first project where the mark actually goes towards the degree! (note: EEEEK!)<br />
<br />
Wish me luck boother peeps! =D</p>

    <p>Good day to you all! =] apologies once again but this booth is yesterday&#039;s booth as I forgot to booth once again =S (I&#039;m getting bad at this these days lol). I&#039;m not entirely to blame though, the intense induction week me and the folks of the IMP house are doing at the moment does leave us pretty strapped for time (note: when reading this, please ignore the fact that other IMP house occupants such as @xFAWNx  and @RandomProdInc have still been boothing xD).<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, this picture was supposed to represent me having a studious day to ensure that the presentation that me and my group give tomorrow (regardless of the fact that it is only 5 minutes long) will be a decent one. I actually put my graphics tablet pen behind my ear to show further studiousness, but the light hasn&#039;t really caught it so you can&#039;t really see it....studiousness fail.....yeah....<br />
<br />
How has your day been? =]</p>

    <p>Yay for networking myself! xD. So today was the start of the first part of what my university has branded &#039;Professional Studies&#039;. This is supposed to help us learn has to integrate in to the working world of media and find our passion. It was, in summary, a very long day sat in a room. It would have been pretty pointless had it not been for the special guest speakers. <br />
<br />
One of them was a guy called Mike who owns an interactive media company. After giving a speech, I stood up and made myself noticed to him. I dropped him one of my business cards, he returned the favour, and outlined a little project for me to take part in so that he can assess whether I&#039;m good enough to do a placement at his company. It&#039;s not much, but it&#039;s definitely a start! =D<br />
<br />
So keep an eye out on here for developments of this little project in between my uni work. One thing is for sure though, Firthy and his &#039;inc.&#039; are on the rise! xD</p>

    <p>Finger gun is primed and ready! xD. My major accomplishment tonight, pathetic and nerdy as it may be, is completing the campaign on Dawn of War: Dark Crusade. I hadn&#039;t played the game in quite a while prior to a couple of days ago, so I took great joy in conquering the plant of Kronus again =]. Thankfully I did so just before I start uni again properly (note: it&#039;s tomorrow eeek!) We&#039;re starting with an intensive week of &#039;professional studies&#039;. It sounds ominous and I don&#039;t like ominous =[. Oh well, we shall see ^_^.<br />
<br />
What have people been up to?</p>

    <p>So Dailybooth, you have just claimed the very last bit of effort I have left for today! xD. In all seriousness it has been a bitch of a day, mainly because I have been just about ill enough for absolutely anything to seem like a huge task. Couple that with 8 hours of work and you have a recipe for one really battered Firthy =P.<br />
<br />
Aleece is also pretty ill this evening (note: she doesn&#039;t have what I have, so I haven&#039;t been mean and given it to her =D) so although a couple of IMP house occupants plus others are heading out for @xFAWNx &#039;s brothers 18th birthday bash, I am confined to the house in order to preserve what energy I have left for...wait for it...another shift at work tomorrow. <br />
<br />
I swear when uni kicks in properly I&#039;m done for....o wait that&#039;s monday. Watch this space to see a person physically crumble day by day. Could be entertaining! lol xD</p>
  </div>

    <p>So this evening I&#039;ve been left scratching my head. I&#039;ve even given you a visual example =D. Today I got my paycheque through for this months wages, and something looked extremely unpleasant about it. Namely that, between pay-as-you-earn tax and national insurance, I have been deducted over 250 pounds! =[.<br />
<br />
Had to ring work&#039;s finance department and thankfully most of that will be added to next months wages, as it was simply the fact that I had been taxed too much for working crazy hours this month =P. So it seems that the wonderful, magical new macbook pro will have to wait until the end of October =/. Sad I know, but it does stop me throwing my money away for another month xD<br />
<br />
Good evening folks?</p>

    <p>Hey all! =] double booth today because of my lack of boothage yesterday. It&#039;s totally explainable though as I had my first day back at university yesterday! So I am now officially a second year IMP xD Exciting indeed! =]<br />
<br />
As for today, we all had to go in for one, ultimately pointless, lecture and got hit by what seemed like a bloody monsoon there and back! =[ horrible weather but I got to wear my hitman jacket for the first time in ages! (people who have followed me for ages would remember this from last year =D).<br />
<br />
Question!: Favourite piece of clothing? (show/tell me!)</p>
  </div>

    <p>Hey all! =] So the fact that I am now in possession of this funky orange pad means that I am now a fully &#039;trained&#039; PAL leader! xD So I&#039;m all set to meet my PAL group properly for the first time next week. Exciting stuff! =D<br />
<br />
I have to say though, the training day itself was pretty boring lol. I understand it is completely necessary for them to tell us all that stuff (it lasted nearly 8 hours btw =/) but we were stuck in one room for that whole time and I was extremely happy to be out of it at the end lol. I then went and took part in my mate @MattC &#039;s radio show for an hour which was really great fun, and has convinced me that I really want to get in to it next year =].<br />
<br />
But enough about me already, how has your days been? =D</p>

    <p>So the verdict on the opening episode of Desperate Housewives season 7 is....WIN! really good return. I still don&#039;t think that it has got back to the same standard of genius writing that got the programme popular in the first place, but it&#039;s certainly on the right track, and the idea to bring back Paul Young as a potential villain is always a smart move (have I given away the fact that I know my Desperate Housewives yet? *sigh* oh well lol =P)<br />
<br />
QUESTION!: Your favourite secret love (may it be a TV show, chocolate bar, woman, whatever really! lol)</p>
  </div>

    <p>sympathy anyone? xD So I just feel completely rubbish today. Did my last shift of this month which is the only positive (but I have to wait until the 5th to get paid =/). I feel like I&#039;m coming down with something pretty nasty, and right before I go back to uni, which can never be a helpful thing =[.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it will clear up soon. Tomorrow I&#039;m in uni for PAL training. Have to apparently spend 8 hours learning how to teach 1st year students what it&#039;s like to be a 1st year student....but surely I&#039;ve spent a year learning how to do that? lol =P. Anyway I&#039;m in for that but the weather forecast looks far from awesome which, once again, is just fabulous lol.<br />
<br />
Right because I have to booth twice today to make up for my lack of boothing yesterday, I&#039;m going to take a before and after booth. This first booth is just before I watch the 1st episode of season 7 of Desperate Housewives (don&#039;t go judging, my girlfriend loves it and I like it too =D).<br />
<br />
So see you in about an hour for the verdict! =]</p>

    <p>Alone in a shop =[ Had a pretty busy morning at work but now everything has died down in the town of Bournemouth (probably due to the ominous-looking weather).<br />
<br />
So now I&#039;m just killing time before I can head back home and chill out...<br />
<br />
and by chill out I, of course, mean go back to work on web design jobs and go to the pub quiz =D<br />
<br />
Also, I met the first year IMP&#039;s today for the first time as a PAL leader! haven&#039;t had the chance to meet any of them properly yet but certainly looking forward to it! =]</p>

    <p>FOR THE GLORY OF THE EMPIRIUM! XD<br />
So since coming back from work today, I have been &#039;geeking out&#039; with Aleece on Dawn of War: Dark Crusade (okay, let me rephrase that, I&#039;ve been geeking out and Aleece has been rolling her eyes next to me =P).<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to lie, I&#039;m amazed at how much I&#039;ve missed this game, I used to play it so much and I&#039;m completely remembering why. Gosh I&#039;m such a nerd and I love it! =D<br />
<br />
Another pretty successful day at work, moving closer towards higher bonuses which is always lovely ^_^. All going towards the new mac which I CANNOT wait to get xD<br />
<br />
QUESTION!: what was your favourite childhood game (bet you can guess from this booth what one of mine was? =] lol)</p>

Last nights party was pretty epic, not gonna lie. Had a giggle to say the least. But Im sure you&#039;ll get updated on information in a later booth, or my boring blurb will be changed hahaaa.<br />

<br />
So this tag line may seem extremely lame, but after working at Solutions inc. for little over a month, they have finally made me up a work badge! =] Always important for people who come in and ask stupid questions/have a go at me for supporting the evil cult that is &#039;Apple&#039; haha =D<br />

    <p>And at last! today&#039;s booth =] and it brings with it NEW POSTERS! xD<br />
So after the night out las night, a few of us took a trip up top Poole to do a bit of shopping and get some lunch. While I was there I decided to start my collection of wall posters for my room...and I started it with some epic ones to say the least =D<br />
<br />
On top we have the awesome rated-awesome Scott Pilgrim accompanied by Ramona and the evil league of ex&#039;s. Then we have the truly epic spartans from the new game Halo Reach, the last Halo game that Bungie will make (note: I physically can&#039;t wait to get this, only pay day is what I&#039;m waiting for before getting it xD) and finally we have a great artist called Andy Riley and his famous sketches from the &#039;Bunny Suicide&#039; collection =]<br />
<br />
Consider my rooms walls splashed with awesome =D</p>

    <p>Right! today I WIll do two booths to make my Dailybooth up to date! =P. Booth one: last night the IMP house and some very special guests all went out to town for the opening of a new club in Bournemouth called Sherbet. Turned out that it looked pretty much identical to the club that was there before but was still a pretty good night ^_^.<br />
<br />
Our friend Andy got especially drunk, crashing in to airers and lying in @xFAWNx &#039;s underwear (as pictured below) he then moved around a lot in the taxi, hit on nobody but guys all night (note: he&#039;s not actually gay, thats the confusing bit lol) and had half a moustache drawn on him when he crashed out at ours after.<br />
<br />
Overall Rating: Awesome/Hilarious/An insight in to Andy&#039;s sexual tendancies. =D</p>

    <p>Oh my, what a frustrating day! getting some really silly questions from customers today. I mean I do get some silly questions every day, but today I decided to write down every stupid question querie and comment that a customer said on my Twitter, and it has only just dawned on me how much stupidity I deal with on a daily basis! =/. Really glad that this job pays well otherwise it just wouldn&#039;t be worth witnessing so many people with so much money, who really shouldn&#039;t be allowed to buy technology like a mac lol.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to read all of the ridiculousness first hand, you can take a look at it on my twitter:<br />

    <p>IT&#039;S DAILYFIRTH! That&#039;s right boys and girls, after boothing/talking about my site so much on here, I have finally added a small part of my Dailybooth world on to Firthy Inc.! People that now visit the &#039;Ashley&#039; page can now cleck below my profile picture on there to see the most recent picture taken of me on my site through Dailybooth!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s exciting times because not only does it add a little bit more personality to my site, but it also shows visitors and potential clients just how awesome the Dailybooth world is! ^_^.<br />

    <p>How am I doing this?!?! So the internet is randomly back on this morning after it going off AGAIN last night. Me and Tom successfully pretended to be Joel at the same time on the phone to a Virgin call centre and they &#039;sorted&#039; it out. Then it went off again =/.<br />
<br />
So now I&#039;m about to head off to work. Will try and do today&#039;s booth from work on the off chance (it&#039;s actually quite a large chance) that the internet goes off again...damn virgin.</p>

<br />
Thank you for all of the kind words from you guys and girls earlier today. It obviously did the trick as my manager said that it was one of the best seminars he had seen at solutions Inc.!!!!!! xD was really chuffed.<br />
<br />
Will try my best to keep booting while the Internet is down so bare with me for now. Must leave now before I get a stroke from all the colour in this room =P. Firthy out!!!</p>

    <p>RAWRRRRR! Scared? lol =D. Just finished watching Monsters Inc. such a brilliant film, so I thought I&#039;d whip out my best Sully impression for you haha xD. Pixar are just great film makers, I really don&#039;t think they&#039;ve ever made a bad film.<br />
<br />
So.....Favourite Pixar film?</p>

    <p>CAMP JUMP!...except I&#039;m in my chair! =P. So this is in aid of the fact that I actually have a day off tomorrow! =D Wouldn&#039;t have been if work had their way today, they wanted me to come in but I said NO!..so instead I&#039;m doing wednesday morning, a late one thursday and both days this weekend...I still maintain that I won because they&#039;re obviously paying me for all that haha =P. Helps towards the sort of sales bonus I get at the end of the month too (I&#039;m on a £75 bonus already this month!) IM ON FIRE! xD hehe.<br />

    <p>Hai, Im playing FIFAA yayayayaayyyy. =]...yeah....lol<br />
So I&#039;m chilling out this evening with my beloved xbox because although it involves staring at a screen for a prolonged period of time, I find it extremely relaxing ^_^<br />
<br />
What relaxes you?<br />

    <p>So here I may well look slightly silly to most, but in all seriousness, this evening has been one of the most lovely evenings I&#039;ve had in quite a while. To celebrate that fact that me and Aleece have now been together for 6 months, I took her to an italian restaurant in town called Zizzi. We sat down with some lovely food, some class Ashburge banter and just the most perfect company I could ask for.<br />
<br />
I know this all sounds a tad corny but it really was a lovely night ^_^. Now all set for some rest before work again tomorrow! lol<br />
Anyone been up to anything nice this evening?</p>

    <p>It&#039;s a strange old day so far today...to say the least. Me Aleece Joel and Fawn went and did a bit of shopping and then pay in some money at the bank, when all of a sudden Aleece goes completely pale and falls to the floor. Luckily I managed to catch her as she fainted but she still hit her head a little. So after being checked over by the ambulance, she&#039;s feeling much better and has me to take care of her ^_^<br />
<br />
She&#039;s talking to her mum right now lol. Good day people?</p>

    <p>Its going to be a long old night =/. Although I didn&#039;t actually think I was going to get round to doing today&#039;s actual booth, I find myself in one of those strange moods where I just can&#039;t settle. Not sure if there is anything on my mind that I&#039;ve forgotten about, or just general worries, but I don&#039;t feel like I can get any rest. Thankfully Aleece is sleeping soundly. I know I could talk to her about it and she&#039;d make me feel better instantly, but I wouldn&#039;t want to wake her up just for my benefit.<br />
<br />
So here I am =/. Do you ever get nights like this? (p.s. sorry about the whole hair disaster right now)</p>

    <p>Morning everyone! as I said the other day, I wasn&#039;t able to booth yesterday because I was at the annual general meeting for my work in Brighton. So this can count as yesterdays. The evening in Brighton actually turned out to be a brilliant night. Got many...many free drinks, free food, had a laugh with some karaoke and went on probably the best ride I&#039;ve ever been on on Brighton pier. It was basically a giant pendulum that raised you up past 90 degrees about 150 foot in the air and then simply dropped you. Was insanely cool xD<br />
<br />
So today I&#039;m very much feeling the effects of last night, so trying to keep myself awake by doing a bit of work with my graphics pen here!. Probably just going to end up watching a film to be honest though lol =D.<br />
<br />
Catch you all later today for today&#039;s actual booth ^_^</p>

<br />
AGM for work tomorrow, getting a limousine down to brighton for the evening. Free food, drink and ride on brighton pier! lol could be rather funny! and apologies in advance if I don&#039;t do tomorrow&#039;s booth until the day after lol ^_^</p>

    <p>Hey all! real life me is off to pub in a bit so Scott Pilgrim avatar me is taking my place for the day, hope you like him ^_^.<br />
Today seems like a rather long day, mainly because on my day off I had to get up early this morning to take part in some online sales training. Wasn&#039;t particularly thrilling but had to be done =]<br />
<br />
I also ordered my new bag in to work tomorrow so will be able to get my hands on it when I do the work delivery tomorrow, so you should all see it when I get back. Exciting! xD lol<br />
<br />
On the down side the weather hasn&#039;t been/looks set to be pretty bad so hopefully the bag won&#039;t get ruined riding home.<br />
What have you guys and girls been up to?</p>

    <p>Question for the boothers. Can I pull off these type of hats? really hope I can because I intend to wear them underneath my headphone so I can listen to music when I ride around in the winter without my ears freezing and dropping off =P lol.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the work uniform hanging in the background, really should take more care over the scenery of my booths lol xD Hopefully the star trek poster totally makes up for it though ^_^.<br />

    <p>Hey boothers! so for a slightly more exciting change, I&#039;m boothing to you all from inside where I work, Solutions Inc.!!!. As you can see from the sign in the window, Solutions Inc. is a premium reseller of Apple products. I&#039;m in to watch the empty shop while my manager gives a presentation downstairs. So for the next couple of hours I am all alone in a shop full of Apple products! =D<br />
<br />
In order to turn this strange occurence in to a funky game, comment on this with a product and if we have it, I will post of picture of me with it! xD<br />
<br />
Ready....set...go! =D</p>

    <p>Hey everyone =] apologies for the fact that my booths have hit a new level of lazy...by actually boothing from my bed lol. Been at work all day and have to be in for the forseeable future, doesn&#039;y make for a particularly happy firthy lol.<br />
<br />
Also I&#039;m going to emergency taxed on my first months wages because I arrived late in the month and my payment forms weren&#039;t sorted out in time. This pretty much makes my first sales bonus irrelevant as the tax man will take it. Bastard.<br />
<br />
Oh well, next month should be much more rewarding financially what with all the shifts I&#039;m working. I could keep rambling on but I fear I shall drift off at any minute. So catch you tomorrow boothers! (will be just watching shop for an hour or so tomorrow evening after work finishes so expect a much more active firthy then =D)</p>

Was really nice to see them all =]. Also managed to consume a LOT of food in process, and because I&#039;m a tad odd, eating that much food has made me rather sleepy lol ^_^<br />
<br />
Got to be up rather early by the standards of the average student for work tomorrow (1 of 5 days I&#039;m working today =/) hey ho, it&#039;s money I guess =]<br />

Don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on with the crazy bits of light on my face, looks a bit like the sights that Predators have in...well all the predator films lol.</p>

Today has been a really productive day to be honest! had to ride back to work to return a set of shop keys I accidentally left in y pocket (I&#039;m such a tool =P) been working with Aleece on the freelance project we are doing and even got a bit of time to play Fifa and watch this amazing show!<br />
Gene Hunt is one of the best TV characters ever! =D<br />
<br />
In other news, managed to eat 4 portions of lasagne plus garlic bread and waffles with syrup for dinner (because I&#039;m a fat shit in a skinny boys body to be honest xD)<br />

It can also help create web pages for the freelance project that me and Aleece are currently working on (it&#039;s slowly but surely taking shape =]). Aside from that, my day has just consisted of fiddling around with pesky bits of Javascript and updating my CV to include my awesome new job ^_^<br />

    <p>OH THE HORROR! xD This booth is completely dedicated to one of the most addictive games I have played in aggggges! it is Plants vs. Zombies by popcap and even though the concept is fairly simple (protect your home/roof from invading zombies using a range of extremely awesome plants) it is just impossible to stop playing! =D as such, productivity has been rather low today. The most me and burge (seen hiding from zombies above) have moved today was to answer the door for the nice man who brought us chinese ^_^<br />

I kind of feel sad that our landlord brought gardeners in to clear our front and back garden. If zombies attack and eat our brains, I&#039;m blaming that guy!<br />

    <p>Right. I know that this looks pretty weird. But bare with me people lol. The story begins when I started work last saturday. I saw that we sold these sweet skullcandy headphones called lowriders and in a lovely black and grey colour too. I&#039;ve been looking for some replacement headphones for a while and these would sit lovely over my hat while riding to uni. But before I could buy them after my shift someone bought them! =[[ (I even had to serve the guy...it was horrible).<br />
<br />
Anyhoo we had a new delivery of stock today and the same headphones were among the new arrivals! xD. S if the weather holds out I will be heading down there tomorrow to grab them (will ring ahead and ask teh guys to put them aside so no man woman or child can come between me and these sweet headphones lol =P<br />
<br />
So tomorrow you will see this same picture but will lush new headphones...do you follow? haha.<br />

On the plus side though, I was top seller again today (2 days out of 3 isn&#039;t bad =D) and after my shift tomorrow I have 4 lovely days off xD. Have to say though, this is definitely the best part-time job I&#039;ve ever had =].<br />

    <p>This my &#039;slightly forced, but still authentic&#039; happy face! lol. Today I had my first shift at Solutions Inc. Wasn&#039;t even properly trained today, but after my 8 hour shift I walked away as the top sales person of the day! xD (beginners luck I&#039;m certain =D)<br />
<br />
Because of my good work, I&#039;m in tomorrow and monday so I&#039;m a bit tired at the moment/soon to be more tired in the future, so apologies if my booths over the next couple of days are slightly lacking in excitement lol.<br />
<br />
Anything noteworthy happen to my lovely followers today? =]</p>

    <p>ARGHHH! me and Joel were just checking out the prospectus for our second year at university....some...err...interesting things to be getting on with next year. Overall though, pretty damn excited to get back and in the swing of things media-wise. Coz we&#039;re nerds like that =P.<br />
<br />
In other news, It was A-LEVEL RESULTS DAY! so congrats on everyone who got what they wanted and commiserations to those who didn&#039;t, don&#039;t give up guys! =]<br />
<br />
Where is everyone off to for uni next year then? I know where me and Joel will be, good ol&#039; Bournemouth babay! straight outta the IMP house! xD</p>

    <p>This photo is completely crazed! but for good reason. I GOT THE MYSTERY JOB! xD so from now in, instead of working in a club I will....be working for Solutions Inc.! A premium reseller for apple products! =D this means demonstrating how to use macs, playing with new products and generally chatting with customers about something that I&#039;m truly passionate about ^_^ add that to the good hours and sales target bonuses and it round off to the best part-time job I&#039;ve ever landed =D So Ice pop to celebrate naturally! xD<br />
<br />
p.s. as a side note, my brother just joined the land of Dailybooth! so go follow him at @HaydenFirthy and show him love! (and help @RobinJ6 &#039;s wet dream of him having more followers than me =P)</p>

    <p>RANDOM MID-WEEK CHANGE OF SCENERY! =D. I&#039;ve popped home for the night, unfortunately though it is to attend a funeral tomorrow. Not the most pleasant way to spend a day, but thankfully will be back in IMP house tomorrow evening to make me feel better.<br />
<br />
Also, I should find out if I have managed to get the mystery job I applied for tomorrow as well; really hoping that they don&#039;t call during the ceremony or something! lol =/</p>

<br />
<br />
Evening! =] Been a fairly regular day today, had to trek to a walk in centre to have Aleece&#039;s hip checked over because she has been in a bit of pain =/ all is ok though =]. She&#039;s just sorting out her uniform for work tomorrow, have you ever seen anyone so happy to be ironing before? lol xD <br />
<br />
No word from the mystery job today so I will contact them tomorrow afternoon to get a verdict. Nervous stuff! =]<br />

    <p>Evening all! sorry for the late booth, I&#039;m about to shoot off to finish the weekend trial at my new job. First shift wasn&#039;t too bad, it&#039;s easy work but slightly boring and lots of walking so my feet hurt =/. Bought insoles for my shoes though so tonight should be a little less painful ^_^.<br />
<br />
Random game!: what&#039;s in the package?</p>

Wanted to show you guys this new canvas painting I got for me wall, I&#039;ve wanted it for ages but restrained myself from buying it to try and save money, but I came back from the premiere last night to find that @Aleece3 had gotten it for me! she&#039;s so lurvely ^_^<br />
<br />
Anybody have any canvas paintings? (random I know lol)<br />
<br />
p.s. interview for the mystery other job went really well this morning, so will know if i&#039;ve got it next monday/tuesday. Fingers crossed! =]</p>

    <p>I will admit, this a rather odd pose to strike for a booth. There are multiple reasons for me doing this though:<br />
<br />
1) It&#039;s a part whistle in appreciation of just how friggin awesome Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is!!!!! xD went to the press premiere last night and it was amazing (got free popcorn too xD lol). Got interviewed for a movie site after which was pretty awesome it must be said.<br />
<br />
2) I remembered that I&#039;m still one booth behind because my little adventure last night took me away from my laptop lol. So this booth shall be followed shortly by another one which will be today&#039;s booth (follow? I know what I&#039;m doing, honestly ^_^).<br />
<br />

    <p>Morning boothers! =] consider this yesterday&#039;s booth pretty please because the IMP house played host to a few friends last night that were rather rowdy, and have just gotten up fairly early with Aleece as she has work early this morning. Thank lord for this new energy drink we&#039;re trying out here in the house lol. It tastes a bit funky but it has a tonne of vitamins in it and so it&#039;s bound to wake you up lol<br />
<br />
Anyhoo last night some of the people went up on to our attic, that we haven&#039;t ventured up to since moving in, and found a whole bunch of stuff! a projector screen, chairs, a mini-fridge, old photos and slides, and even some old teeth!...set up for a really crap horror movie? I think so! lol<br />
<br />
How was your evening last night? =]</p>

    <p>This slightly strange looking booth is my &#039;I just got hired&#039; face! So this time the manager actually turned up and I&#039;ve got a trial weekend to see if I like it there! good times!. Only issue now is that another job I applied for a while back contacted me today and I&#039;ve got an interview with them too! haha<br />
<br />
Will need to juggle things quite carefully to make sure that I still have a job by the end of the week lol would much prefer to work for this other place because it would be daytime shifts but we shall see =]<br />
<br />
What have you lot been up to today then? ^_^</p>

    <p>Howdy! =] So today was a bit of a fail to be honest, I got up bright and early and headed down to the place I was supposed to have my interview this morning, only to discover that the lady I was supposed to have my interview was on a day off =/. So tomorrow I&#039;m heading back for an interview, and with any luck this one may go ahead lol.<br />
<br />
Aside from that completely pointless trip my day has been fairly uneventful, did some reading and played some video games, standard Firthy behaviour lol =] So for the second day running, hopefully I should be employed by tomorrow haha =D<br />
<br />
What profession to you guys work in?</p>

    <p>Good evening =] In-keeping with my promise to show you a little bit more of my new room each day, here you can see my funky windows! ^_^ apparently my room used to be a dining room (hence the funky windows =P lol) I don&#039;t mind so much because it&#039;s really spacious...and it has funky windows haha xD<br />
<br />
I&#039;m also on my BMX, firstly because it was in front of the windows, and secondly because I need to ride it to a job interview I have tomorrow! (dun dun duhhhhh lol) It&#039;s for a part-time job as a barman in a nightclub so nothing major but would be a handy bit of extra money so here&#039;s hoping I luck out and get it!<br />
<br />
How is everything with you fine people? =]</p>

    <p>Bonjour! <br />
I am not Ash, I&#039;m Daisy (@HaDaisyLOL) and I&#039;m be boothing for him today because he&#039;s off moving into a fab new house WITHOUT internet! He&#039;ll be getting it soon, don&#039;t worry ^_^<br />
I can be found on Youtube aswell! I&#039;m not going to go all pluggy here because that&#039;s just... ungood, but on Youtube I&#039;m subscribed to this guy - @RandomProdInc <br />
And quite recently he did a meme theme week; one video involving him, @Stve , @MattC and our own lovely Ash going all epic over The Killer&#039;s - Mr Brightside.<br />
And that right there is how I was introduced to Ash Firthy!<br />
So in this booth I ask you; how did you first come across the awesomeness that is Ash Firthy? :)<br />
Comment below Firthy followers!</p>

Well, for the more clever of you, you would know I am not infact Ash, I am @Majaarr, I&#039;m boothing for my dearest friend because he&#039;s moving over the next few days. :3<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really know what to say here - So I think I&#039;ll just end it here. ^-^<br />

I&#039;m waving because, unfortunately, this will be the last time for a couple of days that you shall see me! =[ This is because I will be moving in to the new IMP house later today and our internet connection won&#039;t be set up until wednesday! =/<br />
<br />
However, you can look forward to two lovely booths regardless, as I leave you in the very capable hand of miss @Majaarr and miss @HaDaisyLOL ^_^<br />
Have a fun few days boothers and I look forward to talking to you all again from within the comfort of the IMP house =]<br />

    <p>Hey boothers =] as you can see, my bedroom is pretty bare (not that you see too much of my room on these booths anyway lol =]). Most of my stuff is now all packed up because I move in to my new house tomorrow! I literally cannot wait =D.<br />
<br />
In other news, its my 250th photo today! randomly just saw that. Seems like a crazy long time! lol<br />
Also, for anyone wondering what the poster on the back of my door is, it is the awesome joker from dark knight ^_^<br />

This booth is in celebration that, thanks to the lovely @RandomProdInc, I will accompanying him to the official press premiere of the new film &#039;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&#039;!!! xD<br />
For those who haven&#039;t heard of it, check out the trailer on youtube and be amazed! It&#039;s based on a comic book series and, what with me being a geek and all, it&#039;s right up my street! lol ^_^<br />

    <p>Good day to you all! =] I have a slight problem booth-wise that will come about in less than a weeks time. You see, although sunday brings the awesome day when I move in to the wonderful IMPhouse, it also starts 2 and a half days without an internet connection =[. This is, of course, a complete disaster, so we will have to survive without internet until ours is set up on wednesday<br />
<br />
And so now its time for me to call on my lovely boothers for a helping hand ^_^<br />
I need to find 2 lovely people to booth for me on the monday and the tuesday so that I don&#039;t miss 2 days worth of boothing<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?</p>

    <p>hey all =] really sorry for the late booth today but I just got back from a poker night with a few of my mates. Was really nice as I hadn&#039;t seen most of them in quite a while. Aside from that, it has been an extremely unproductive day lol. I&#039;ve watched a lot of the TV show &#039;Arrested Development&#039; that I&#039;m really getting in to at the moment. Has anybody seen it?<br />
<br />
Really random question. Favourite suit in a pack of cards? ^_^</p>

    <p>Heyyyyy =] as you can see I&#039;ve lost a fair bit of hair from the general head/face area today lol. Finally got my hair cut and had a shave some nice and presentable now haha. Kinda already miss my long hair but, to be honest, it grows back so quickly and I barely ever get to see my hairdresser these days lol.<br />
<br />
What do you all think? does shorter hair work too? ^_^<br />
<br />
Did some more general updates on my portfolio today, now going to relax for a bit and watch a film this evening, any suggestions as to what I should watch?</p>

    <p>Hey! =] today isn&#039;t the greatest day ever because Aleece has gone back home to London =/. Will miss her loads as usual, but thankfully its now only 6 days until we move in to the new house with all the other lovely IMP&#039;s! xD<br />
<br />
Apart from that news, not much has gone down today, I&#039;ve updated by &#039;Ashley&#039; page on my portfolio though to try and make a tad more awesome, if you&#039;ve got a minute to have a look at it and let me know what you think than that would be equally awesome ^_^<br />

    <p>Evening boothers! =D as you can see, I&#039;m fairly knackered atm as it&#039;s been a pretty long day! Aleece has been showing me around some awesome parts of London, from the London eye, to hyde park, to regents street and all the crazy tube rides that go with it! lol My favourite part was the apple store, just because there was so many lovely things in there I wanted! hehe ^_^<br />

This evening I will mainly be packing for tomorrow when I take a train to visit the wonderful @Aleece3 in London (won&#039;t lie, been looking forward to this for ages now xD). May also do a bit of reading and just generally relax before all of the traveling tomorrow =]<br />

    <p>Hey everyone! =] thought I&#039;d booth just before I head out the door for work. I noticed as I was getting ready that my hair has got so damn long recently (curse my hairdresser going on holiday for 2 weeks the day I get back from uni! =[ lol). So anyhoo, I think I&#039;ve found a really subtle way of hiding my how long my hair is while I work....you think it will work? =D<br />
<br />
How has everybody&#039;s day been? =]</p>

    <p>This may seem like a rather ridiculous pose to strike for booth, but I&#039;m doing it for a good reason...you wouldn&#039;t be able to see my face if I didn&#039;t because of the sun! haha<br />
As has been the case for the past few days, the weather is completely undecided as to what it wants to do (the weather was horrible a couple of hours ago =P)<br />
<br />
Been at work again today, extremely boring but its all going towards rent and my phone so its not too bad ^_^ <br />
<br />
Anybody done anything funky today? =]</p>

    <p>Evening everyone, sorry for this booth being slightly late, had to stay on at work a bit later than usually, mainly because a bar flew in to the bar and kept setting off the motion detector alarm so we had to guide it out. I love how it managed to get in through a small window and yet couldn&#039;t seem to find the big ass door we opened to let it out! haha<br />
work itself was pretty dead and boring, thankfully a special someone (hint: it was @Aleece3 xD) kept texting me to keep me smiling ^_^<br />
<br />
Not seeing much commenting going on on my booths over the past couple of days, hopefully the weather is so good wherever you people are so that you&#039;re not online. Or you&#039;ve all abandoned me...hoping its not the latter to be honest.<br />
<br />
if you fancy a chat at all then just drop me a comment, you lovely boothers you ^_^</p>

I spent yesterday down at my friend&#039;s beach hut just chilling out by the beach and it was lush! =].<br />
Today I&#039;m just working on a little update for my portfolio and going to watch the amazing film that is &#039;Pulp Fiction&#039;! =D<br />

    <p>Drink anyone? =D today I had my first shift back at the pub since coming back from uni for the summer. It was a pretty boring shift as it wasn&#039;t busy at all, but felt nice to be back in the old place again and, at the end of the day, its all extra money for the house in august! xD<br />
<br />
Off down my friends beach hut this evening for a little while to see some old friends which should be pretty fun, but as you may have noticed from the picture, the weather isn&#039;t too great outside atm =/<br />
<br />
Anybody done anything noteworthy today? ^_^</p>

Today has been a fairly up and down day. Got dragged by my younger brother to see the new Twilight film...it was shockingly bad lol.<br />
After that I came home and have had to fix my BMX, try fixing my xbox controller and try and sort out my camera...how very active of me! haha<br />
<br />
Go back to work at the pub for the first time since being back tomorrow, have to ride there =[ not good.<br />

Two weeks until I see Miss Burgess again. Bad, bad times =/.<br />

    <p>hey everyone =] bad news! I&#039;ve got a bit of a cold atm =/ (amazing, considering the ridiculously warm weather we have her lol). Hoping to get over the most of it before @Aleece3 &#039;s birthday tomorrow! she&#039;s a tad excited xD lol.<br />
Been working on the portfolio again today and popped in to town to get the last few things needed for Aleece&#039;s festivities.<br />
<br />
So random question for you today:<br />
What is your favourite ever birthday present? <br />
<br />
To return to Firthy&#039;s follower of the day after the post-results day celebrations, today&#039;s follower of the day is @Majaarr coz she&#039;s always tagging me in booths and coz she&#039;s a legend anyways ^_^</p>

    <p>Hey all =] so today I was working a bit more on my portfolio site (progress is good by the way ^_^) and this little fella came sneakily in to my view.<br />
<br />
Safe to see that I have been playing xbox with it since then haha =P<br />
<br />
Just generally chilling out after all the excitement of yesterday =] told me parents about my result and they seemed pretty chuffed which is always nice ^_^<br />
<br />
Not sure if everyone is a big gaming fan, but what is your favourite video game of all time?</p>

    <p>Part 2! the official verdict is:<br />
PROCEED TO LEVEL I, ELIGIBLE FOR CERT HE WITH MERIT<br />
this means...I passed with a 2:1 !!!!! xDDDD<br />
Excellent stuff really pleased!<br />
<br />
This means that all you of you boother&#039;s will definitely see me in the IMP house next year for my second year of study! woohoo! xD</p>

    <p>Part 1 of the two biggest booths since being here. Firstly, sorry for not boothing yesterday but, as you well know, I have the tendency to get stuck in to my work and not be able to tear myself away from it lol.<br />
Anyhoo, in about an hour I will be able to log on to my uni site and find out if I have passed my first year of university, all of the tiresome booths cursing work and all the celebratory booths enjoying assignment hand-ins all lead to this.<br />
<br />
The uni site should only tell me if I have passed or failed though, so after I will walk in to uni to get a letter containing the full run down of my mark.<br />
<br />
So here goes nothing, wish me luck! =]</p>

    <p>Hmmmm not a great day tbh. Went to the bank to try and get them to give me the money I&#039;m owed.....yeah you got it, they didn&#039;t give it to me =/. Complete pain =[. Going to chill out for the evening to feel a bit better <br />
Not the greatest day ever though =/<br />
Hope yours has been better guys<br />

    <p>Hey everyone! =] I&#039;m sorry that tonight&#039;s booth comes a little later than previous days, but I have only just returned to Bournemouth after visiting my home town of Southampton to watch a gig there. As you may have guessed already, the band was called KarmaTribe and they are made up of three of my very good friends (one of them is even on here! the enigma with dreaded hair that is @RobinJ6 ! xD)<br />
<br />
Because of this, Firthy&#039;s follower of the day for today is Mr @RobinJ6 who played a humorous and extremely enjoyable set after not playing with the rest of the guys for nearly a year! Look forward to seeing him and KarmaTribe a lot more over the summer ^_^<br />
<br />
How have your days all been? keep me informed and I can read them tomorrow and I&#039;m aware some of you may be in bed right now depending on what corner of the earth you are in =D</p>

    <p>Such a good purchase! xD went to poole today with @Aleece3 and bought myself a desk fan...it is perhaps one of the greatest things I have ever done =D (see happy pose above to see I&#039;m not joking)<br />
<br />
Got some design work for the portfolio website done today which is always good, and have watched my first bit of wimbledon tennis this year to see andy murray take control of his match =] So overall a good day =]<br />
How was yours?<br />

Firthy&#039;s Follower of the Day today is @HaDaisyLOL , who had her last exam of the year yesterday and is always commenting on my booths and being generally wonderful. Congrats miss daisy and thanks for being awesome ^_^</p>

    <p>FRUSTRATING BANKS GRRRR! lol<br />
let me explain, santander owe me some money because I&#039;ve had my student account open for a while. This money is already 4 weeks late and, after being assured that it would be paid in today, guess what...yeah its not there lol. Damn banks!<br />
<br />
anyone else had trouble with banks before?<br />
<br />
Aside from that have had a really nice and chilled out day. The weather is unbelievable here! =] how is things with everyone?<br />

    <p>OMNOMNOMNOMNOM! xD Nipped to Asda today as I have had the biggest craving for peanuts all day! lol<br />
Been a fairly frustrating day, went to uni to give a campus tour to what turned out to be chavvy teenagers. Not sure why they were there as the chances of them getting in to uni are about the same as italy winning the world cup...and they were just knocked out =P.<br />
<br />
Now just more of the same in terms of website creating and chilling out, much nicer! ^_^. What have you people been up to?</p>

Found out mexico made it through the group stages of the world cup, so thought I&#039;d pay homage to them lol ^_^<br />
Today I&#039;ve continued to crack on with the website re-brand, slow and steady but there&#039;s a chance I may win a race that way! =D<br />

    <p>Hey all =]. I&#039;m not staring at the screen atm because I&#039;m looking for funky looking things to add to my new portfolio site!. As my regular followers will know, I&#039;ve been banging on a lot about re-branding and giving my site a completely brand new look and feel to it, and today I&#039;m pleased to say that it has officially started =D<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve got some definite ideas in my head and, with the help of the wonderful @Aleece3 , we&#039;re getting cracking!<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t I just look concentrated? lol =P</p>

    <p>Hey everyone, I know late booths are becoming a bit of a bad trend of mine regardless of the fact that I&#039;ve actually finished uni for the year and I apologise for that. Today hasn&#039;t been a great day tbh. Today is the anniversary of Grandad&#039;s birthday who, very sadly, is no longer with us. As some of my older followers know, my grandad has been the single biggest influence on my life and, no doubt, will continue to be for the rest of my life. <br />
<br />
So I am bringing back the &#039;answers on paper&#039; thing I had going before and am starting with a very simple question; who is your idol?</p>

    <p>Ahh hey there dailybooth, just typing away on my mac here and figured I&#039;d stop by. I set myself a challenge this evening, to conquer a bit of code that I plan to add to my portfolio over the summer as part of my re-brand...easier said than done. It&#039;s been a bit of a pain to say the least but I&#039;ve definitely made headway with it! =]<br />
<br />
How is everyone then? lets get a little chat going, because I&#039;m starting to believe that you&#039;ve all disappeared suddenly or you&#039;re all robots =P<br />
<br />
p.s. I don&#039;t actually work with my hood up just wanted to show that I&#039;m wearing a shirt with a hood....THATS RIGHT! SHIRT WITH A HOOD! XD LOL.</p>

    <p>Bet you&#039;re wondering a couple of things about this picture:<br />
1) Why is firthy pulling that strange facial expression?<br />
2) why is he not in his normal room?<br />
3) what the hell is that bright light in the corner?<br />
<br />
wel...<br />
<br />
1) This is me showing that I am half extremely excited and half spooked as I will be heading to thorpe park with some friends tomorrow, and amongst other things shall be trying out Saw alive for the first time...an interactive horror maze!. I looooooove rollercoasters loads but this will be the first time I try anything like this! xD<br />
<br />
2) I&#039;m at @Aleece3 &#039;s place after having tea and playing Sims 3 (geeks! =D)<br />
<br />
3) I have no idea whatsoever why there is a bright light there lol<br />
<br />
Hope everyone is well!<br />

    <p>Hey all =] sorry about the delayed booth for yesterday once again, I know it has happened a couple of times recently, but I had such a relaxing day yesterday to celebrate pretty much finishing the first year that computery things pretty much just left my mind, so I apologise =].<br />
<br />
For anyone interested, my final first year project has moved to a proper web address now so you can find it at http://www.whatifpolitics.co.uk =D<br />
<br />
In other news, yesterday would have also been my 200th booth! xD simply insane how fast my dailybooth experience is passing by, seeing as I started this about a month into my course, mental! =]. Please excuse the lack of photoshopping/more interesting photo but I&#039;ve only just got back to my flat from my girlfriends (hence the slightly tired face). You will get todays booth later once i&#039;ve slammed some essay work ^_^<br />
<br />
Love you all xxx</p>

    <p>I bet you&#039;re wondering why I&#039;m sat here staring at my finger and holding up a peace sign huh? well its a metaphor ya&#039;see. The finger represents the first (and biggest) part of my final first year project that is complete. I presented the idea with two group mates and the site and concept seemed to go down really well, so am pretty chuffed by that ^_^. Now I just have to finish my last peer assessment entry and complete a 1,000 word production analysis essay and my first year as an IMP will officially be over *tears up a little* =D<br />
<br />
This also means summer soon! so will get to enjoy Bournemouth life a little bit more with some free time I reckon. I&#039;ve already promised myself that I won&#039;t be too lazy though, don&#039;t want to go forgetting everything I&#039;ve learnt this year! lol So will continue with the re-design of my portfolio which, of course, as my followers you will hear all about ^_^<br />
<br />
So yeah, it&#039;s a genuinely happy day =]. How about you&#039;s lot then? lol</p>

dailybooth doesn&#039;t seem to cover all of the link so just copy and paste it all in to your browser ^_^<br />
<br />
ok well it slightly is, it will be moved to a proper site address soon, but this is the server it has to be uploaded to for now so that it can be marked by the uni. So! feel free to browse and interact, and naturally let me know if there are any problems you encounter =]<br />
<br />
Just to let you know the whole politics idea wasn&#039;t mine, I just created the website and all the little bonuses including maps, games etc along with two other IMP&#039;s. So let me know what you think of those most of all xD<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
p.s. if you could all register on the forum and leave nice comments and message on the episodes and podcasts then that would rock! thank you lovely people!!! xD</p>

    <p>HEY ALL! I know that once again this is a late booth but there is a good reason behind the first happy booth in many, many days.....I&#039;VE FINISHED THE PROJECT! It all has to be checked out tomorrow morning on the big screen we will be presenting on but in essence, its actually done. Been waiting so damn long to say that and I feel like I actually deserve to say it now ^_^<br />
<br />
So after it all gets checked out tomorrow, you boothers will be the first to see my new project in its entirety and interact with all the little bonuses xD<br />
<br />
Soooo happy right now =D<br />
<br />
Anybody else happy?</p>

    <p>Hey boothers! by deepest apologies for not boothing yesterday, will make up for it today =]. As you probably guessed from the lovely @RobinJ6 being present on my page the other day, I am currently completely rushed off my feet with work trying to get this project sorted. It&#039;s at the point where most of the work is done but all the pieces need to come together and fit to finish off the piece, it&#039;s quite an annoying process I must say =/...<br />
<br />
However, despite this the completed project should be finished and ready for you all to see/interact with.....TOMORROW! thats right! once it&#039;s been completely tech checked then I will post the link and see what you guys think of the site and all of its bonuses =].<br />
<br />
But as for today, the work carries on =/ but you shall see a much happier Firthy in the next few days as the project comes to a close...in fact you may even see a slightly happier me later today depending on how well the work goes! hehe =D<br />
<br />
Hope everything is all funky with you people ^_^</p>

    <p>Apologies for the late booth people, been relaxing this evening after a full-on day. It began with an emergency dentist appointment who told me that my teeth were fine (yayyy xD) and it was a problem with my gums, so have to pick up my prescription tomorrow because the pharmacy was out  of stock =/. Then did a 3 hour stretch of coding with one of my group members in order to get closer to finishing our project (finished item will be ready for you to see promise! =D). <br />
<br />
So had tea and watched some &#039;my name is earl&#039;, now aleece is asleep behind me and i&#039;m very much heading that way too soon. Night boothers!, will be more chatty tomorrow, promise! lol ^_^<br />
<br />
p.s.. @Jolly is a sexy thing and always nice to see him boothing on here &lt;3 lol =]</p>

    <p>Well the good times sure lasted long =/ on top of my huge work load for my collab project, I&#039;ve also started having huge trouble with one of my back teeth. The gum around it is swollen and painful and I&#039;ve been told that its probably either an absyss or a new tooth pushing threw. Either way, there&#039;s a fair bit of pain involved =[. Seems to be one thing after another these days. All I can say is, thank god for amazingly supportive girlfriends.<br />
<br />
Really hope you guys are feeling better that me. Would love to hear about your day, always nice to hear that you&#039;re having fin adventures =]</p>

been a long ass day today, stuck in a mac suite working on my project. On the plus side, it had air con, a projector with surround sound and some great coursemates of mine. So we worked and watches star trek and lord of the rings =D. Now after accomplishing much, I&#039;ve just had tea with Alex and @Aleece3 and will soon be venturing to the pub. Its been a good day for once ^_^<br />

    <p>Hey all! sorry for the late booth, but yet again it seemed to be one of those days. To be honest I don&#039;t se it changing until this final project is over. It was such an interesting piece to work on at the start but the deadlines have moved closer and a couple of lazy members have left the rest of us with a lot to so with even less time. Not impossible though, just requires many, many hours working which gets you to a point where you take a booth like this.....understand? lol =D<br />
<br />
How many england fans have we got out there that will be watching the world cup shortly?<br />
(p.s. i will get round to replying to all comments soon I promise =])</p>

    <p>Hey everyone =] Hate to be fairly repetitive in my booths but it kind of symbolises the day-to-day happenings of my work life at the moment. Its taking over my free time so my apologies if my booths seem pretty boring. Personally, it will be nice to look back on these pictures when my first year of university is over and see what I managed to battle to make it through =]. <br />
<br />
On the plus side, there should be another new site for you lovely people to have a look over when its finished ^_^.<br />
Random question to make this booth more exciting!<br />
Favourite cartoon show ever?</p>

    <p>Oh hey there boothers, don&#039;t mind me, I&#039;m just on the ground. I&#039;ve been doing web development for a large part of today as my collaborative project moves to within two weeks of completion =/. We&#039;re just about on track but, as it is with most big projects, you always feel a lot better when things to start coming together. Doesn&#039;t help that one member of my team has gone AWOL either =[.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo have you guys had a better day than me? for your sakes I really hope so haha =P</p>

    <p>Hey all! pretty average today i&#039;m afraid as I had to go in to university for a group meeting...that less than half of the people turned up to =/ then had to do a fair bit of work as well so hoping to enjoy a relaxing evening with any luck ^_^. On the plus side though, bought me some new ultra-comfy SoulCal jogging bottoms today in town! xD If these things never get dirty or smelly, I swear i&#039;d never get out of them lol =P<br />

    <p>Apologies for the late booth you lovely people, but as you all know yesterday was my birthday. Therefore I am now wading through the dreaded &#039;morning after&#039;. As you can see, the flat is a bit of a state after the escapades of me and my friends before we headed off clubbing, and sufficed to say that I am a little fragile today =/ lol. Nevertheless, yesterday was an absolutely amazing day and me and @Jolly had an incredible time.<br />
<br />
So, has anybody got any drunken stories from nights out? =P</p>

My fellow IMP, future housemate and great friend @Jolly shares this momentous day with me and we are totally prepared to celebrate it to the full!<br />

    <p>Good evening everyone =] apologies for the late, post-shower, poor quality and slightly vain booth today, its been a pretty hectic day!. I have arrived back on Bournemouth safe and sound after spending the weekend with my family which was niiiiice =]. Went to town today and decided, as it was my birthday soon, that I would treat myself to a few additions to my work space, so here, in awful quality, is my new:<br />
<br />
Graphics Tablet from Wacom<br />
Laptop stand for my mac<br />
500gb External Hard Drive<br />
<br />
But of a splurge on money I will admit but totally worth it as it will all help me do the work on my course I need to ^_^. <br />
Anybody else have a slight obsession with spending when it comes to something?</p>

    <p>Hey all! sorry for the late booth but its been kind of a fail day today. Went to try and do a nice thing by helping out at a school fete that my mum had to take part in, and ended up getting sunburnt on my arms and nose (as you can see =[). On the other hand, always nice to see my family and friends back home.<br />
<br />
Going back to Bournemouth tomorrow, looking forward to seeing a certain someone that will certainly improve my mood ^_^<br />
How has everyone been?</p>

    <p>Hey all! =] Today can be summed up by these 2 pictures: the first being me waiting outside the assignment office to pick up the last theoretical essay of the year, and the only thing, besides the collaborative project we are working on at the moment, that could stop me making it the second year of my course at university...the second picture speaks for itself =D<br />
<br />
I passed pretty well but the main thing is that theory is effectively over for the year and I have survived! =] so pretty happy I must say =]<br />
<br />
In other news, 2 more questions to go before the end of this. So todays is:<br />
<br />
Q. What is the name of the main character in my recent project in Flash animation:<br />
<br />
A) James Napier<br />
B) Sam Winchester<br />
C) Ashley Firth<br />
<br />

    <p>Good day to all your wonderful people! I&#039;ve had a fairly lazy day to say the least, playing video games and watching TV shows (gotta have a day off sometime =P). I started thinking about going home this weekend to see my family, and the funny stuff that me and my brother usually get up to. He&#039;s a huge part of my life as many of you know and I&#039;m really looking forward to seeing him.<br />
But the big question is....:<br />

    <p>Had a pretty crazy day today guys, me and @RandomProdInc stage a takeover of our friend @MattC &#039;s radio show on our university station &#039;Nerve Radio&#039;. Was hilarious stuff that included technological disasters, talking about driving cars on to boats and tom pretending to be a tall hunky swedish man. Overall an awesome day. <br />

It got me thinking about my love for music and how it surrounds pretty much everything I do. So today&#039;s question is:<br />
<br />

<br />
A) Fightstar<br />
B) Muse<br />

    <p>Hey guys and girls, sorry for the very late booth but today has been so hectic you wouldn&#039;t believe. My friend and electro life partner @RobinJ6 came down to Bournemouth to prepare for our gig....which is tomorrow...=/. This is also effectively the first time that we&#039;ve practised for said gig. So thoroughly expect a booth tomorrow informing of you of just how horrifically bad it went (which will also be a tad late as i&#039;ll be on stage....did I not mention that we have the headline slot...my bad =/ lol)<br />
<br />
How has everyone&#039;s day been then? (if any of you are still up =P)</p>

    <p>Hey all! how has the day been for all my lovely followers? I started today with an early start in order to meet with my production group for my collab project, so i&#039;m a bit tired but we now have a potentially great idea to work from (more info will come soon I promise). In fact, I may call on you lovely people in the future booths to be the select first few people to test out certain things, but we shall see how things go ^_^. <br />
<br />
Aside from work, I have started playing fifa08 (old school I know lol) and forgot how easily I can get addicted to football games. May seem boring to most but I seem to love them! haha.<br />

    <p>Good day to you all! Today I&#039;m attempting to but a 3,000 word essay I have to do in 9 days out of sight and out of mind...for a while at least lol =]. I have an eye appointment today to see how bad my eyes have become which is a tad worrying =/. So I&#039;m escaping for a while by creating music. For those of you that are wondering, I am a bassist but its back at the flat and i&#039;m learning a bit of acoustic ^_^<br />
<br />
So today I want to know what your passion is. That one thing capable of saving you from bad moods and bad times and makes me smile. Let me know!!! =]</p>

    <p>Today I bought myself a little present. I&#039;ve been searching on eBay for a while and today finally got my hands on an old school Playstation 1 console! =D. I&#039;m such a fan of old school games (Crash Bandicoot, in particular, is completely full of win lol =D).<br />
<br />
So guys, on paper once again, tell me what was the last major thing you bought?<br />
If you&#039;re worried about saving the rainforest and wasting paper....just plant a tree after commenting on this booth or something haha ^_^. Hoep you&#039;re all fine and dandy this sunny day! (well it&#039;s sunny where I am anyways hehe =])</p>

    <p>Today is a slightly sad booth I&#039;m afraid. Today my lovely girlfriend @Aleece3 popped back to London for the week before our third term at uni starts. I know it&#039;s only a week but I&#039;ve spent nearly two weeks straight with her and so I shall miss her =[<br />
<br />
So today I want you to write down the name of the person you miss teh most. Feel free to explain why too if you want. I know it&#039;s not exceptionally happy as usual but hey, we&#039;re all friends here lol =]<br />
Hope everyone&#039;s ok ^_^</p>

    <p>Hey all! =] as these &#039;word-booths&#039; seem to be getting everybody talking (which is always awesome =D) I reckon I shall continue with them for the time being! ^_^<br />
<br />
Anyhoo today I have written down my favourite band &#039;Fightstar&#039;. I own pretty much everything they&#039;ve ever made, seen them live and own signed merchandise. Their music is almost a compulsion for me and very few people like them....which is love xD.<br />
<br />
Soooo follow me lead people! I wanna see favourite bands on paper in front of my eyes! =D lol. Feel free to add favourite tracks, live venues and why you like them too if you wish ^_^<br />
Also hope everyones having a good day =]</p>

    <p>Yet another fun game for all you lovely followers of mine =]. Today my brother came down to Bournemouth to spend his birthday with me ^_^ (excuse the strange looking picture of him lol). On this post-it I have placed the relative that matters most to me. I trust my brother completely and he is completely awesome =D. <br />
<br />
So todays challenge! Tell me the relative that matters most to you!<br />
Feel free to explain why if you wish, nobody will judge you =]</p>

    <p>So todays fun little activity! I want you all to write down on a post-it (or small piece of paper, whatever =]) the one word you feel best describes yourself as a person. It can be absolutely any word (no made up ones tho lol =P)<br />
<br />
I will start by describing myself as &#039;PERFECTIONIST&#039;. Everyone that knows me will tell you that when it comes to my work, I am never pleased with my own material and will continue a seemingly never ended struggle to create something I&#039;m proud of....this struggle is still continuing as we speak! haha<br />
<br />
So! dazzle me with your words people! xD</p>

Now I know this may seem like a strange choice in TV show for me, but I&#039;ve been watching this for agggges now and am re-watching atm with Aleece because it simply is that good!<br />
<br />

Spent the day with @Aleece3 and we went majorly old school. We&#039;ve spent nearly 10 hours playing the Playstation 1 game &#039;Crash Team Racing&#039;!!!!! =D<br />
It&#039;s been nothing short of epic but now we&#039;re hugely knackered. Aleece says &quot;num num num num!!! (maybe coz she&#039;s nomming on the controller.....bless ^_^).<br />

    <p>Right final guess the follower of this little series (apologies to some of my followers that couldn&#039;t get involved, didn&#039;t mean to make you feel left out =]).<br />
Only two people could potentially win this, either @RandomProdInc or @Jerry. Which is why the clue for today is only one word. This shouldn&#039;t make it tough at all for either of these guys tbh, it&#039;s just who notices this booth first I guess haha. Anyhoo, the word is<br />
<br />
BROHAWK!<br />
<br />
I want the name of the person and the @ tag on dailybooth. GO!!! xD<br />

p.s. because of a mix up with my opticians I now have to wear my glasses for a while before I can get new contacts, what do people think of my new look? lol =]</p>

First person to answer correctly gets bonus Firthy marks =D<br />
<br />
Today has been a rather slow day, last lecture of the term turned out to be pretty useless and I got caught in the rain with just a t-shirt and shirt on. Bad times =/. So just chilling out now, can anyone guess what I&#039;m doing? ;)<br />
<br />
Everybody else had an ok day?</p>

    <p>So it&#039;s been a looooong day Dailybooth peeps. Been helping quite a few course mates out with their projects as the hand in is tomorrow morning. Always glad to help but it has left me pretty drained to say the least lol. Also had a shift at one of the pubs I work at earlier today back in Southampton so have also worked and travelled today. As I said, a looooooong day lol. Just over my shoulder is my bed and it is becoming more and more appealing by the minute. However I&#039;m making myself stay up and do theory and design work because I seem to have a huge problem disconnecting from my work, as I&#039;m never happy with my own work =/. <br />
<br />
Tell me people, what is your main flaw?</p>

    <p>Inside your laptop/computer screens today could potentially be a double dose of Firthy!<br />
1) this booth right here<br />
2) my flash animation that is now online! =D<br />
<br />
Thats right! the result of months of my work now has its own page on my portfolio website and here is the link!:<br />
<br />
http://www.firthdesigns.co.uk/flash.html<br />
<br />
feel free to browse, view and even interact with the mini game! =]<br />
(The actual animation is the bottom button. If it takes a while to load then  apologies. It does on a couple of computers that don&#039;t have great internet or the latest flash player but it will load promise! hehe =D)<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think guys =]</p>

    <p>So I&#039;m still battling with Flash I&#039;m afraid. It&#039;s sucking my life and will power and unfortunately my booths are suffering, haven&#039;t had a happy Ashley booth in a few days now =/. You guys and girl have all been so supportive thus far, but I must ask you again to raise my spirits to spur me on to beat this thing.<br />
<br />
So if you fancy trying, your task is to make me laugh! could be a funny joke, picture (I&#039;m looking at you, @Pseudoart lol =]) or anything you can think of! =]</p>

    <p>Today has been frustrating dear dailyboothers. Still in the midst of my battle with flash, the culprit of my annoyance is ActionScript. All I wanted to do was make a piece of music play when a certain movie clip started and its throwing up errors. Hence the angry fists....its not a just a bad john travolta impression promise lol =]. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to get past this obstacle and push on. Better get back to it.<br />
<br />
Question for you all today: can you do Spoc&#039;s hand sign from Star Trek?post a picture comment with you doing it for major lols and to make me smile =]</p>

    <p>Hey hey =]. So today I&#039;ve been soldiering on in the technological battlefield against my arch enemy Adobe Flash. For some reason though, I seem to work better with slight distractions in the corner of my eye....is that weird?...it probably is lol. Anyway I managed to view all 3 matrix films and most of season 1 of &#039;Pushing Daisies&#039; which I have to say I&#039;m very fond of ^_^. <br />
<br />
Any of you guys seen any of these before? =]</p>

    <p>It&#039;s time for war people! My flash animation project is due in one week and I must still fight it tooth and nail in order to complete every aspect of the brief. This is my forewarning to my dedicated followers that my booths may not be hugely interesting this week as I attempt to battle the juggernaught that is Adobe Flash. I shall do my best to keep you all amused this week though ^_^.<br />
<br />
So followers! get behind me with your war paint/war gear and help me battle flash!!!!! xD</p>

    <p>The photo I have taken today is me on the train back home for the weekend. Need to run some errands so just popping back to Southampton lol =]. However, this picture also has another meaning. I wanted you guys to take a look at my portfolio website and see what you think of it. I&#039;ve recently made a lot of changes to it and hoped you would share you thoughts with me =D. The address is:<br />

Please feel free to be honest, there are some more changes to be made to it before its handed in, but would be good to know what you all think =]</p>

    <p>So today I decided to re-ignite my fairly pointless formspring account as I&#039;m hardly ever asked questions =/ lol. Thats where you guys come in! lol. I know I did something similar to this a couple of weeks ago but the perk to this is that you can also ask things anonymously! so you can go ahead and ask me the most random and potentially embarrassing things you can think of! haha =D. Will be interesting to see what you guys can come up with ^_^<br />

    <p>Right so I know this actually happened a couple of days ago, but now that I am safely above that number I can celebrate the fact that I have 100 FOLLOWERS!!! =D. All thanks to you guys for making me so welcome on here and taking the time to comment on my pictures. I&#039;m really not one for huge blurbs because basically I know that they become annoying to read after a while lol. Alas, this will be a slightly longer one than my usual blurbs lol. So massive love to all of my followers, especially the ones I have heard from almost on a daily basis (you know who you are =]). So thanks once again, and here is a quick list of the people that have been especially awesome to me on here (sorry if I forget anyone lol =])<br />
<br />
@RandomProdInc (Fellow IMP, Fellow Featle, Fellow future flat mate, awesome friend)<br />
@xFAWNx (Queen of Dailybooth and the first person to follow me on here (honoured much! lol =]) course mate and extremely privileged to have met her =])<br />
@Jerry (Met him through a mixture of fawn, red bull and vodka haha. Really kind hearted person and a pleasure to have met him)<br />
@Jolly (Shares a birthday with me born in the same hospital within a couple of hours, thus we share a soul haha. Has turned out to be one of my best friends)<br />
@Aleece3 (considerate, caring, reliable and has been there for me when i&#039;ve needed her....and all of this despite coming from london lol. Couldn&#039;t imagine not knowing her and don&#039;t plan on finding out xD)<br />
@Stve (Fellow Featle. I always feel as though I can talk truthfully to this guy, he tells it how it is, i&#039;m a big fan =]. Plus he&#039;s badass to his very core haha)<br />
@MattC (Fellow Featle and recently assigned the role of badass DJ lol. I trust him completely, probably because he&#039;s a doctor lol)<br />
@HaDaisyLOL (Hugely loyal to my page =D. A fellow nerd, self confessed fangirl and consistent smiley presence on my picture comments, thank you =])<br />
@Pseudoart (Has never failed to make me laugh with his remarks and picture comments since he first started following me. Guaranteed to always pick my mood up and for that I thank him hugely =])<br />
@fishiwan (One of my earliest followers (third I believe) and has been nothing but nice to me =] has also provided me with some very solid advice at times over my time on this site. Utter legend =])<br />
@Majaarr (A fairly recent follower but has already made me smile many times with her witty comments and love for Fightstar that we share. Very happy to have her around my page day to day =D)<br />
@LoonyLawreeLove (Well what can I say about this girl? haha. Absolutely full of life (even more so when she has anything sugary haha) constantly positive and a joy to hear from on dailybooth. Thanks loony =])<br />
@RobinJ6 (my musical and electro partner in crime lol. One of my greatest friends from back home and now a member of dailybooth due to my constant nagging lol. Can&#039;t wait to make sweet music with him again lol)<br />
@lozzehlowskiski (Definitely the best person of polish decent I have ever met haha =P. This girl has never let me down and has supported me and my paranoid ways more times than I can count, I&#039;m slowly trying to pay her back with advice and beer haha. Thank you for being one of the best people I&#039;ve met since being in bournemouth =]<br />
@Crinoline_Gremlin firstly, please don&#039;t be upset you&#039;re last on the list, wasn&#039;t intentional haha. Beginning to learn more and more about her, mainly her work in musicals which is tres interesting =]. Very happy to have her as a follower =].<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really sorry if i&#039;ve missed anyone out that I shouldn&#039;t have, and everyone else, its simply that I don&#039;t know you that well just yet. So hop on to a booth and lets get chatting =D</p>

    <p>Right so this picture will mean a lot more to the IMP followers on my DailyBooth as they are all in the same boat as me. Personally, I have been wrestling with the mega annoying adobe flash program for the best part of today in the hope of making some progress towards finishing my cartoon animation for my uni project. Now I am slowly getting there, but my god this program is a pain in the ass!. This is an actual conversation my and the flash icon has today....both voices may have been done by me though.....lol.<br />
<br />
Anybody else met their match in a computer program before, or just technology in general?</p>

    <p>So today me and fellow IMP&#039;s have been working hard in university on our animation projects in Flash. And naturally, because we&#039;re first year students, we&#039;re complete n00bs at it!. This picture is basically to sum up what our faces have been doing all friggin day! frustrating much! =/. <br />
<br />
QUESTION: what frustrates you these days?<br />
<br />
p.s. Luke plans to murder you all.....he has a list.....and you&#039;re on it =[</p>

    <p>So today is the day! It&#039;s epic face off time!!!. Make your choice! who has the sexier face? (my vote goes to @Jolly personally! =]). Winner will be crowned Mr Sexy Face for the end of the uni year. Mainly because that would be an amazing nickname for Joel haha.<br />
<br />
TIME TO VOTE! =]</p>

    <p>Today I fell back in love with the concept of the weekend. For the best part of today I put media options, animation and website work and all my other troubles out of mind and just enjoyed the things around me. Staring out of my window into nothingness I realised that I&#039;m extremely lucky to have the things I have in my life. Because of this I&#039;ve decided to go back to writing songs tonight, looking forward to disconnecting and doing what I love doing. <br />
<br />
How has everyone&#039;s sunday been?</p>

    <p>This is my really crap confused face....but its for a very good reason. I&#039;m looking over my media theory options for what I can study next year and in the first term I have to choose between media &amp; popular music culture and Media &amp; Fictional Violence. Essentially, my uni is asking me to pick between my music (basically what my life is) and violent xbox games (which take up my life, pretty sure cod will even be a case study). How do they expect me to choose!?! =[<br />
<br />
Faithful followers! help me out! what do i do?</p>

    <p>Today I learnt two things about going shopping in town with @xFAWNx :<br />
<br />
1) It can be pretty damn fun =]<br />
2) It can be pretty damn expensive lol<br />
<br />
This is not, of course, Fawn&#039;s fault at all, more the huge appeal of funky shoes and amazing shirts with hoods attached to them! xD<br />
<br />
So people, Show me/Tell me the last thing you bought! (I&#039;m talking of reasonable expense, not bottles of coke etc lol)</p>

    <p>Today I got tickets for Hall Wars: Round 2!!. Now I don&#039;t know if any of my older followers remember back to the booths about the first round of this, but it turned out to be a crazily awesome night in which my halls &#039;Purbeck House&#039; came away winners. We&#039;re going to defend our crown next monday, the challenges are fairly routine, they include:<br />
<br />
*Gladiator Duel<br />
*Pole Dance-off<br />
*Dirty Pint<br />
*Tug of War<br />
- and the list does actually go on haha.<br />
<br />
Todays Question - Have any of you guys ever been a part of something crazy like this before? lol<br />

    <p>So this morning my day was made infinitely better by the fact that my copy of Fightstar&#039;s &#039;Be Human&#039;: Deluxe Edition album turned up....SIGNED BY THE BAND!!!! xD. Now I know that lots and lots of people are not fans of Fightstar but they have been a love of mine for so long now and a huge influence on all of my own music so this was something that made me hugely happy. Definitely something I will cherish forever. <br />
<br />
Does anybody else have any cool band related stuff? or even anything that they truly cherish?</p>

    <p>Bit late in the day for my booth, but I have been working pretty solidly on the storyboard for my current animation project. Very tiring stuff, so tired I haven&#039;t even been able to finish nomming on my late night snack! lol =].

The results of my courses second white t-shirt social now takes its place on my wall alongside the first. Was a very fun night, lots of people and lots of socialising......o yeah and lots of drinking, that too xD lol<br />
<br />
Notable features of this time round, the batman symbol (if you look closely =]) a little cartoon of Dr. Tran (don&#039;t know if anyone knows what that is lol), the pIMP writing (as our course is interactive media production so we are &#039;IMP&#039;s, see the play on words...yeah? lol =]) and, as always, the inclusion of a penis drawing, as is protocol with occasions like this haha<br />
<br />
Thank you to my graphiti friends, @RandomProdInc, @Jolly, @Aleece3, @Stve, @MattC, @KTPolkaDot and many more!.....who really should have Daily Booth by now! lol =]</p>

    <p>Hey all =] Today instead of going in to uni as usual, I had to take my flat mate Joe to have a procedure on his eye, not nice. So to boost his morale we drew him a temporary eye and eyebrow while his is healing. pretty life like huh? lol =D<br />
<br />
And if you look closely below his new drawn on eye, you can see that his blood has made it through like an inch of bandage that is over his eye! gruesome stuff! lol</p>

Night was pretty eventful, @RandomProdInc had a chat with a girl working for &#039;for your eyes only&#039;, lauren had to walk home behind a guy drunkenly trying to pee in the street, and we were all asked very politely in the club if we would like to buy some meth.....strange times haha =]</p>

    <p>So yeah multiple things going on in this photo as you can see. Allow me to break it down for you =]:<br />
<br />
1) The nerd glasses were the costume of choice when me @Randomprodinc, @Aleece3, @Stve, @MattC and Lauren (who has DB but its too difficult to remember to tag lol) when out clubbing last night. Also did some pretty awesome lip syncs, will be on youtube in the near future! =]<br />
<br />
2) My halls of residence have installed an IP phone in to my room. It has proven fairly useful thus far only by allowing me to ring my flat mates, who are like 6 foot away from me. Ones even in the next room haha =P<br />
<br />
3) That is a mouse shaped like a car. I don&#039;t even need to describe the epicness of that really do I lol =]</p>

    <p>Today&#039;s photo sums up the many sins I have seen in bournemouth today. Ignorance in the form of tutors incapable of accepting that a student may know slightly more than them on a subject that they specialised in for three years, Sloth in the form of a group member that seems to truly define how to be undedicated to what you do, and what seems to be everybody&#039;s gluttony in their obsession with constantly filling the centre of bournemouth with cigarette smoke. My sin is to envy other people who didn&#039;t have a day as frustrating as mine.</p>

After creating our vlog, I have been rooting around to find old live footage of us and a couple of single releases from our second album, in prep for the YouTube release of the first single from our upcoming third album!.....get all that? haha so yeah pretty crazy times<br />
<br />
In honour of what i&#039;ve been doing here is a couple of pieces of official (and i say official meaning not even a little bit official haha =D) CBK merchandise! Any followers have any kapow-related clothing?<br />

Was also planning on man hugging @Stve and @Jerry, woman hugging @xFAWNx (as i&#039;m guessing she probably wouldn&#039;t want man hugging lol =]) raping @Jolly and serenading @Aleece. All that shall have to wait til I get back to bournemouth next week i suppose. I think a late night snowball fight may be on the cards this evening tho =]</p>

    <p>Well here is the last booth I will take in my flat this year, as I&#039;m heading home to Southampton for christmas tomorrow morning. I thought I&#039;d take this booth surrounded by photos of the greatest moments of this first term being an IMP. This has already been some of the best months of my life and I can&#039;t wait to come back and keeping doing it in 2010. I&#039;m going to miss my fellow IMP&#039;s and flat mates lots and have even started planning reunions with one of them lol =P<br />

So yeah next time you see me I will be back on the waterside. On another note, todays anthem is &#039;Thunderstruck&#039; by AC/DC, in honour of the fact that they have been confirmed as one of the headlining acts of the always epic download festival which I shall be attending next year.

    <p>Today has been a bit of a downer to be honest. Had a lot of work to do (and still do) which i&#039;m doing my best to power through, am extremely tired from severe lack of sleep and got very wet walking back from viewing a house with some fellow IMP&#039;s. On the plus side it is looking very much like it could be our new home for next year =] As for the DVD, its just a very old school film that I thought might make me smile during my breaks in work...and its working =]<br />
<br />
Today&#039;s anthem is &#039;Brick by boring brick&#039; by Paramore, really catchy band and I also happen to be very much in love with hayley williams (as are a lot of guys lol =P) enjoy!!! =]</p>

    <p>Hello again my lovely DailyBooth peeps. You are currently seeing a picture from last nights pre-drinks before yet night out in wonderful Bournemouth Town =D<br />
You are also seeing the band known as &#039;The Doodlers in all their glory:<br />
Mr Joseph Shea<br />
Mr Christopher Carne<br />
Mr Sam Pothecary <br />
and of course me<br />
Mr Ashley Firth =]<br />
<br />
The somewhat snazzy catchphrase at the bottom comes from our love and respect for the almighty David Bowie, although we still hate playing fame! lol<br />
<br />
<br />
.....O and just to clarify, we&#039;re not actually a real band, we&#039;re a half drunk student filled guitar hero band. But we love it XD<br />
<br />
In honour of this first picture of the band, I will now add a daily anthem for each of my DB pics from now on =). So to start things off, todays anthem is....<br />
<br />
Life on Mars? - David Bowie.........FOR BOWIE! =]</p>

    <p>Chances are I will be completely hammered tonight and thus thoroughly incapable or even turning on a mac when i return home, so my booth today represents me my flatmate Chris and our mate Sam as the amazing (and yet completely fabricated) guitar hero band &#039;The Doodlers&#039;! <br />
<br />
As a side idea from this picture, anybody have a favourite track from all of the guitar hero games?</p>

    <p>Just about managing to get todays picture on here before 12 lol. As you can see i&#039;m on a train back to Bournemouth after contributing some vocals in a gig in my hometown of Southampton!. It was an awesome night and all the nights performers were brilliant. We all also did an 8 part rendition of Oasis&#039; famous &#039;wonderwall&#039; which was an amazing experience =]</p>

<br />
For today&#039;s picture I wanted to show you guys a bit of the madness that took place last night. Me and a group of my IMP course mates, including @xfawnx, @ThatsWhatSteveSaid, @ThatGuyCalledJollyJoel and @RandomProdInc had some pre-drinks at Joel&#039;s flat. As a random spur of the moment thing from the day before, we filled Joel&#039;s room full of balloons and...well you can see the results lol =]. <br />
<br />
Head hurts a bit this morning but still a great night =D</p>
