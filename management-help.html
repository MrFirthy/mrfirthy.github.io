            <p>Managing a team for the first time? Expanding into new countries or disciplines? I can help.</p>

            <h2>What's the point?</h2>
            <p>Management is a difficult and unique challenge. There are <em>many</em> approaches and <em>a lot</em> of content out there, but none specific to your situation and feelings. I offer one-to-one sessions to allow people to feel more prepared to lead.</p>

            <h2>What makes you qualified?</h2>
            <p>I'm not a veteran of management, but the hyper-paced nature of helping take a start-up to a global company worth over $5 billion in a few years has forced me to learn a lot in a very short space of time. It's also exposed me to nearly all company sizes, and taught me what works within them. Here are a few of the things I can teach based on my experience, primarily from <a href="https://octopus.energy" target="_blank">Octopus Energy</a>:</p>
            <ul>

                        <p>The most typical frequency is fortnightly, but it's largely down to what you're looking for. This cadence allows me to come armed with content specific to your needs and situation.</p>
